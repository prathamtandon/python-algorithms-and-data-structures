My implementation of problems in Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Ed
in Python. To run the test cases, you should have [Pytest] (https://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html)
installed. Also, following data structures have been implemented
in Python:
* Linked Lists (double links)
* Tries
* Binary Search Trees
* Stacks
* Queues
* Priority Queues (Min heap)
