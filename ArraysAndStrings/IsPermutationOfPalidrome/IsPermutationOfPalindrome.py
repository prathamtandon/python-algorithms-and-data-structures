# Accepts a string and returns if it is a permutation of a 
# palindrome. 
# Example
# Input "Tact Coa"
# Output True ("taco cat","atco cta" etc.)

# There are several ways of doing this. The important thing is 
# to understand that we just have to tell if the string is a
# permutation of a pallindrome, we need not find the palindrome itself.
# This means that if the given string satisfies the properties of a
# pallindrome - ie it should have even number of same type of letters
# with at most one letter which occurs just once (eg. "abba" or "aba")
# we can tell whether the string is a permutation of some palindrome.

# To actually find the counts of different letters, there are several
# ways of doing this. An elegant solution involves having
# an integer bitmask with one index for each letter in the input string.
# Each time we encounter a letter, we "toggle" the corresponding bit
# in the mask. After scanning the entire string, if the bitmask value
# is zero or if it has exactly one bit set, we return true
